1] [Initals Printer](str_initials.cpp)

This is a C++ program that allows a user to input their full name and extracts the first and last names. It achieves this by searching for the first space character in the input and then printing the first name (up to the first space) and the last name (everything after the first space).

The program is simple and straightforward, making it a basic example of string manipulation in C++.
